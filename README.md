## Project description
Create and validate a model which will detect and classify objects based on image analysis using the YOLOX framework (https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX). The model should detect whether people entering a construction area wear a proper safety gear. Specifically, it should detect objects like: person, helmet, head, vest. Special attention should be given to false positives (a bald person or a person with a hat resembling a helmet). The following public data set can be used for training:  Hard Hat Workers Dataset https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/hard-hat-workers created by Northeastern University - China (it contains more objects than listed above).
